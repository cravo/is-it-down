# Is it down?

This is a simple dockerised app to check if a web site is down or not.  No trackers, no ads.  The check is done server-side, so if you can't access a site from your machine, then the server where this is hosted will check the URL for you.  If it can access it, it's a problem local to you.  If it can't, it's probably just temporarily down.


[Docker compose](docker-compose.yml) is available if you want to self-host.
